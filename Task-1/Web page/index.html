                Environmental awareness is to understand the fragility of our environment and the importance of its protection. 
                Promoting environmental awareness is an easy way to become an environmental steward and participate in creating a brighter future for our children.

                </p>
                Before you can begin promoting environmental awareness in your community, you must first make sure that you have a thorough understanding of 
                environmental issues. Stay up to date on environmental news, read books and other resources, and learn about the issues affecting your own community.
                It’s much easier to talk to others about the environment if you’ve already taken the time to educate yourself.
                Numerous resources are available to promote environmental awareness and education: group learning (inside or outside of the classroom), informational and inspirational seminars, online courses, books, articles, videos, and brochures are just a few of the tools that can get you involved in promoting the environment.

                <p>    
                    It is the long-term heating of Earth's climate system observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere.
                </p>
                <p>
                Some major causes of global warming are:

                The environment can be saved from these harmful effects if all humans collectively take action against them. Some helpful tips for sustainablity are:
            </p>
            <p>
                1) Consume less: Curbing consumption can have a huge impact on the environment. The three "R's"—reduce, reuse and recycle— get a lot of attention, but the planet could benefit from some focus on the most important and most underrepresented "R": refuse.
            </p>
            <p>
                2) Compost:
                Another “R” that doesn’t get much attention but has important environmental implications is “rot.” As in, let your food and yard waste rot naturally in the soil instead of sending it to the landfill. In other words: compost.
            </p>
            <p>
                3) Choose reusable over single-use: 
                Think about how many people you see each day drinking beverages from disposable cups or disposable bottles, sipping from disposable straws, carrying disposable grocery bags, eating from disposable plates or containers and using disposable utensils. All that single-use plastic has to go somewhere, and it’s had a devastating effect on our soil, oceans and marine life.
            </p>
            <p>
                4) Upcycle more:
                Get creative with your useless or unwanted items by upcycling—basically, turning trash into treasure. Creating something new such as artwork, toys or jewelry is both satisfying and one of the best ways to protect the environment. 
            </p>
            <p>
                5) Recycle: Educate yourself on what can and cannot be recycled in your bins at home. Throwing the wrong items in the recycle bin can result in an entire load being rejected, and back to the landfill. Hence, recycle properly.
            </p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column">
                  <img src="images.jfif" alt="i3" style="width:100%">
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                  <img src="i4.jfif" alt="i4" style="width:100%">
                </div>
              </div>
            <p>
                6) Shop secondhand: Instead of heading to the mall to buy new clothes, consider looking first in a thrift store or vintage shop, or trading clothes with friends. You can breathe new life into your wardrobe without wasting the precious resources needed to produce new clothing.

                Shopping secondhand also applies for many other categories of consumer goods: children’s games and toys, shoes, appliances, furniture, cars and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                7) Buy local: Check out your local farmers market for fresh, package-free food; try eating at a farm-to-table restaurant; and buy from local artists, clothing makers, and retailers before you click for that two-day shipping.
            </p>
            <p>
                8) Use fewer chemicals: Use fewer harmful chemicals and you’ll be on the right track. It’s hard to be sure about the long-term negative effects chemicals can have, both on our bodies and on the planet, so it’s best to avoid them if possible. Opt for chemical-free lawn and garden care; all-natural beauty and hygiene items; natural household cleaners; and organic food.
            </p>
            <p>
                9) Walk, bike or carpool:
                According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year.1 Any amount of that we can cut back on will help. For short trips, try walking or biking—you’ll also get a healthy dose of exercise in, without setting foot in a gym. If travelling on foot or two wheels isn’t feasible, try carpooling with a friend, neighbor or coworker to a mutual destination. And if all else fails and you need to drive your car, line up errands in the most efficient route to save time and miles driven.
            </p>
            <p>
                10) Use less water.
                Conserving water at home is one of the easiest ways to protect the environment. Think of all the times you consume water, both inside and outside your home; then, make adjustments as you can.
